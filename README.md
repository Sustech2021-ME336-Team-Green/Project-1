# BionicDL-CobotLearning-Project1: 2D Picking of (x,y)

In this project, we reproduce a learning algorithm using 2D images to conduct a simple picking task by identifying the object location.

## Environment Setup

The neccessary 3rd-part library is recorded in the file `Requirements.txt`

```
Cython
matplotlib>=3.2.2
numpy>=1.18.5
opencv-python>=4.1.2
pillow
PyYAML>=5.3
scipy>=1.4.1
tensorboard>=2.2
tqdm>=4.41.0

pyrealsense2
torch==1.6.0
torchvision==0.7.0
```

run the following command to setup the environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
