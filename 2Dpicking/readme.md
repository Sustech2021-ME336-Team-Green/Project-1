# 2D picking 

This part is a toturial to finish the 2D picking task. Before doing this part you need to finish 2D calibration part fist. If not,please finish it.

## Experiment theory

The color image obtained by the sensor and the visual recognition algorithm are used to calculate the grasping point, and the manipulator is controlled to reach the grasping point to complete grasping.In this experiment, the latest YOLO5 object detection algorithm was used to obtain the object Bounding Box, and the grabbing point was the center of the object Bounding Box.
